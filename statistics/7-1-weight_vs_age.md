[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>>  The scatterplot suggests a weak relationship between mother's age and birth wegiht.  .

>>  Pearson's correlation is  0.07, while Spearman's
is  0.09.  The difference between them suggests a non linear relatinship or an influence of outliers. 

>> Plotting percentiles of weight versus age suggests that the
relationship is non-linear.  Birth weight increases more quickly
in the range of mother's age from 15 to 25.  After that, the effect
is weaker.
